- Hi, I’m Justin
- I have finished my Software Engineering program at Conestoga College I had a blast learning a lot about coding
  I'll be posting some of my projects and just learning more
  
- I’ve learned a bit about C and C++, I do want to learn more about JS, HTML and C# though...
  - I have learned some HTML and JS and C# in previous terms!

- I'm quite new to git (Sept 2021) so I hope to post some of my projects from my first year and the I hope I continue in my second year now posting more projects
